          <h3>Deep Purple</h3>

          <p>They are considered to be among the pioneers of heavy metal and modern hard rock, although their musical approach changed over the years. Originally formed as a psychedelic rock and progressive rock band, they shifted to a heavier sound with their 1970 album Deep Purple in Rock. Deep Purple, together with Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath, have been referred to as the "unholy trinity of British hard rock and heavy metal in the early to mid-seventies". They were listed in the 1975 Guinness Book of World Records as "the globe's loudest band" for a 1972 concert at London's Rainbow Theatre and have sold over 100 million albums worldwide.

            <h3>Led Zeppelin</h3>
            <p><cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Led_Zeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a></cite> was an English rock band formed in London in 1968.</p><br>

            </figure>
            
            <p>With their heavy, guitar-driven sound, they are regularly cited as one of the progenitors of heavy metal, although their style drew from a variety of influences, including blues and folk music. Many critics consider Led Zeppelin one of the most successful, innovative, and influential rock groups in history. They are one of the best-selling music artists in the history of audio recording. Rolling Stone magazine described them as "the heaviest band of all time", "the biggest band of the Seventies", and "unquestionably one of the most enduring bands in rock history". They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995; the museum's biography of the band states that they were "as influential" during the 1970s as the Beatles were during the 1960s.

          <p>They are often cited as pioneers of heavy metal music. They distinguished themselves through occult themes with horror-inspired lyrics and tuned-down guitars. Black Sabbath were ranked by MTV as the "Greatest Metal Band" of all time and placed second in VH1's "100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock" list. They have sold over 70 million records worldwide. Black Sabbath were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006.

          <p class="detail">Apr 12</p>
          <p class="detail">BLACK SABBATH ANNOUNCE ‚ÄòSUPERSONIC YEARS ‚Äì THE SEVENTIES SINGLES BOX SET‚Äô ‚Äì A LIMITED EDITION 7‚Äù VINYL BOX SET RELEASED JUNE 8TH THROUGH BMG</p>
          <p>Despite a run of legendary hit singles in the 1970s, Black Sabbath and the seven-inch single format didn‚Äôt always sit well together. After the release of their debut single ‚ÄòEvil Woman‚Äô in 1970, followed by their ultimate explosive chart success with ‚ÄòParanoid‚Äô, the band were not comfortable with the confines of the mainstream pop format and the audience it brought them, leading to their now legendary self-imposed ban on releasing singles in the early 70s.</p>
