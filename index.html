        <h2>Evolution of Heavy Metal</h2>
        <p>
          In 1986, something strange happened. Heavy metal became the most popular music in the world; and everywhere you'd looked, kids were growing their hair long, flashing the devil-horn sign and playing air guitar. 
        </p><br>

          <figcaption>Parental Advisory Label</figcaption>
        </figure>
          
        <p>But not everyone loved it. Critics thought it was unsophisticated music for unsophisticated people. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parental_Advisory"><strong>Mary "Tipper" Gore</strong></a> led parents in a charge to censor heavy metal, resulting in the now-familiar<em> warning labels.</em> Religious groups launched their own crusade against heavy metal. They feared it was a vessel for the devil and had created a <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/features/9-of-the-craziest-crusades-against-rock-and-metal"><em>satanic epidemic</em></a> among teenagers. And then, the lawsuits came. Metal artists were sued for causing kids to commit suicide or even murder. Heavy metal became the moral panic of the day. This music has millions of passionate fans worldwide, yet for years, it's been consistently stereotyped, dismissed and condemned. Why has metal provoked such polar reactions? To answer this question, I'm going to take you into the world of heavy metal.</p><br>
        <h3>Origins</h3>
        <p>Before we get into how metal has divided people, let's firstly explore a subject that has long divided metalheads. Who gets to be called the first heavy metal band? This debate has been going on for decades. 
        </p>

          <p>It was here on the gritty streets of Birmingham, England, in 1970, where Sabbath took music to a darker, more sinister place. Most people associate <strong>Black Sabbath</strong> with <em>Ozzy Osbourne,</em> also known as a reality-TV dad; but it was <strong>Tony Iommi,</strong> Sabbath's guitarist, who is responsible for creating the band's sound and the first true heavy metal riffs.

        <h3>The Sound</h3>
        <p>
            Since Black Sabbath, the sound of evil has become a defining element of heavy metal. But what makes metal sound evil? 
        </p>
          
        <figure class="quote">
        <blockquote>
          The blues scale has the flat fifth, the tritone. That's the devil's note. Like, in the old days, you weren't allowed to use that note. But Black Sabbath, their title song... you know, Black Sabbath, is totally working the diminished fifth. The tritone.
        </blockquote>

        <figure class="quote">
        <blockquote>
          You know, in the Middle Ages, the tritone was identified as the music of the devil because it apparently was the sound one used to call up the Beast. There's something very sexual about the sound of the tritone. I think that in the Middle Ages, people who were ignorant and scared, when they heard something like that and felt that reaction inside their bodies went, oh-oh, here comes the devil!

        <p>
          There's an ongoing battle in heavy metal to be more evil than the band that came before you. But, there's more to this music than just sounding evil.
        </p>
          
        <figure class="quote">
        <blockquote>
          If you don't have an electric guitar with really good amps and really good distortion, you don't have the core of metal. You also need to have a really strong bass sound in it. Bass with the bass guitarist and bass with the bass drums.

        <p><strong>Iron Maiden</strong> is a part of the <em>new wave of British heavy metal,</em> a movement that is built of the foundation laid by early metal bands. They honed a sound that is faster, heavier and more melodic than their predecessors'.</p>

        <p>Dickinson's operatic vocal style has had an enormous impact on heavy metal music, and although people don't associate metal with virtuosic styles of music like classical or opera, it's these influences that make metal unique.
        </p>
          
        <h3>Musical Roots</h3>
          
        <figure class="quote">
        <blockquote>
          The classical roots of heavy metal are fairly obvious. I would say, most of the practitioners, most of the really really good ones were fans of dark classical music. And in some cases dark, powerful, heavy classical music, like Wagner. He actually reshaped the orchestra. He added tubas, he added extra basses, he added an octobass, which is which is actually a double-sized bass violin, that two people to play, Laughs, one guy on a stool fingering it, and one guy, you know, one guy playing the bow. And he just loaded down the bottom end of his orchestra, so that when that orchestra, played the rafters shook, there was so much bass. It was the first time anybody really heard that live.

        </figure>
          
        <figure class="quote">
        <blockquote>
          I still believe that if Richard Wagner had actually been around today, he'd probably be in Deep Purple, or Beethoven would've been happy to be in Led Zeppelin. And the music itself, because it was so huge and it didn't have amplification then, they had orchestration, I think again belongs to that metal environment.

        <p>Of course, heavy metal has another musical ancestor, one whose roots lie deep in the American South. 
        </p>
          
        <figure class="quote">
        <blockquote>
          The origins of metal really can trace itself back to the blues, in America. And that, of course, is very much an oppressed music and it very much spoke to people that needed something a little different. It was about a factory worker coming out of the factory wanting the energy to come out in a different way, in an entertainment form that was theirs and theirs alone.
